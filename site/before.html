<body><header>A learning disability is an umbrella term for a range of neurologically-based disorders
in learning and various degrees of severity of such disorders. Dyslexia is a specific
learning disability that is neuro-biological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties
with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.
These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language
that is often unexpected concerning other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective
classroom instruction.

		<h2> Introduction </h2>

		<article><p>This chapter deals with the explanation and background of Dyslexia. Having to know
                 the different types of dyslexia there are, helps understand how to come to the solution of
                 automation much faster and easier. Thus, this chapter also deals with the information
                 about all different types of dyslexia present, to bring a clear picture about for the problem
                 statement. This chapter also deals with the motivation for implementing the project
                 along with the outcomes expected after the completion of the project.</p>

                 <p>In India the issue of dyslexia, public awareness and acceptance is
                 low. Most Indian schools do not have programs to help children with learning disabilities,
				 and teachers are not generally trained to deal with the issue, if not completely ignorant
				 of it. Schools simply dismiss children with learning disabilities as badly behaved and
				 hopeless. Our tool will help analyse the student's skill and give a probability of how well
				 the student could be or not towards the dyslexic scale making the teaching and parental
				 decision much easy. This is mainly done with a series of tests and scoring each test with
			     respective and according scores which are pre-analysed depending upon research from
				 psychological papers and researchers.</p>

       	        <p>The progressive building of learning skills, such as attention, memory and thinking can be
                characterized as the development of cognitive skills in children. Children are expected to
                develop these skills for leading a normal life where they can excel in a field of their choice.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
        	    <p>Most children develop the required cognitive skills easily while few of them maybe
                unable to do so. When a child is struggling to cope up with tasks common tasks like
                reading, spelling, writing or math he or she may be suffering from a Learning Disability.
                This condition may hinder a kid from performing daily activities which come naturally
                to other children of their age.</p>

			    <p>Learning Disabilities or Disorders can be deffred as a wide range of neurological process-
                ing problems that hamper the development of intellectual abilities of a child. Learning
                disabilities if remain unrecognized can last a lifetime. This makes the person distressed
                and generally suffer from trauma and affliction for a long time.</p>

			    <p>Dyslexia can be seen as a speciffic learning disability that has bears severe effects on
                language development and also has a large impact on reading and other language de-
                velopment based functioning. This essentially means that the impairment of the ability
                to read and write. It has been estimated that around one and a half to ve percent of
                the population have certain symptoms of dyslexia making it the most prevalent type of
                learning disability.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement and Objectives</h2>

		<article>
			<p>Research on the detection of Dyslexia in children at a very young age is still in its early
			stages. Detection of Dyslexia in children before they begin their formal education is an
			important task that can ensure proper treatment for the child.
			Dyslexia as a disability is fairly ignored in many parts of India due to the nature of
			the disorder and lack of awareness. In this work, the proposition is to develop a software
			solution that can aid in the detection of dyslexia in children and one which is widely
			accessible to the public.</p>
		</article>

		<h3> Objectives </h3>
		     <ol>
		     	<li>Develop a software solution to test the phonemic awareness of a child about to
					enter formal education and assess the risks of the child being dyslexic by employing
					various scientifically and medically proven tests.</li>
				<li>Develop the the tool as a cost effective, interactive and easy to use solution as
                    opposed to classic tests that require some prior knowledge and experience.</li>
             </ol>
